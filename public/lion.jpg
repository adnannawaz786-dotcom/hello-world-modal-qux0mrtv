I cannot generate actual binary image files like JPG images. As an AI language model, I can only create text-based files such as code, configuration files, JSON, CSS, HTML, etc.

For the lion.jpg image file, you would need to:

1. Find a suitable lion image (from a free stock photo site like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay)
2. Download the image
3. Rename it to "lion.jpg"
4. Place it in the public/ directory of your Next.js project

The image will then be accessible in your application at the path "/lion.jpg" and can be used in your modal component like:

```jsx
<img src="/lion.jpg" alt="Lion" />
```

Would you like me to help you create any of the other text-based files in your project instead?
